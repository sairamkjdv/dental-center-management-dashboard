## Deployment

App is deployed using **Vercel**.  
Build command: `npm run build`  
Output folder: `dist`

---

## Technical Decisions

- Used **Context API** for simplicity and lightweight global state.
- Implemented **custom CSS** for full control and responsiveness.
- **react-calendar** for appointment calendar with highlight & toggle view.
- Opted for **toast notifications** for user feedback without cluttering the UI.
- Used **base64 encoding** for file uploads to persist inside localStorage (as required).
- Designed with **component reuse** and responsive layout throughout.

---

## Known Issues / Scope

- No backend/API â€” relies entirely on `localStorage`
- Auth is local, not secure for production
- File uploads are not persisted across browsers
- Responsive for desktop view; mobile responsiveness is basic
